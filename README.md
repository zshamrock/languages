## Motivation
Practice is always required to gain an experience with any language. While you are learning the language, the best way when you are more or less confident with it, build the sample application (probably the same one or slightly modified) you've used to build before with different language.

So you know the 'business' of the application, and just focus on the language details to implement it. Unless you have the idea of the project to build, there are some exercises I find useful to implement (is this dojo?) to understand language's features.

There is no **only right way to do it**. The idea is to **experiment** and **explore** the language, get the **feeling** of it. Learn how to **build**, **structure**, and **test** the programs written in the languages of choice.

> **Note:** exercises will be added and improved through the time.

## Exercises
### 1. factorial of N
Simply create the program to calculate the factorial of N. The idea is to explore language's features, which are useful to do the task. You can either print the result of one factorial, or print the list of factorials, or accept the user input from stdin/console.

### 2. Read till 42
Read numbers from stdin (one at a time) and print it back to stdout. Stop when you read the number 42.

### 3. Testing
Explore the way how to do testing in your language. Add tests for the *factorial of N* exercise.
